# LinkedIn OpEd: India's Democratic Backsliding - What Business Leaders and Policymakers Need to Know

*The systematic targeting of minorities and civil society has profound implications for international relations, business confidence, and regional stability*

---

As business leaders, policymakers, and global citizens, we cannot afford to ignore the alarming developments emerging from India this week. New reports from credible international organizations document a coordinated escalation in human rights violations that should concern anyone invested in democratic governance, rule of law, and sustainable business environments.

## The Crisis Unfolding

Three critical developments this week paint a disturbing picture of India's trajectory under the current BJP government:

**Legislative Discrimination**: The 2025 Waqf Amendment Act represents more than religious policy—it's a systematic dismantling of constitutional protections for minority communities. By stripping Muslim religious institutions of autonomy and enabling state seizure of properties, this legislation undermines the very foundation of property rights and religious freedom that underpin stable business environments.

**State-Sanctioned Violence**: CIVICUS Monitor's documentation of systematic torture and enforced disappearances of student activists in Delhi reveals a government willing to use extreme violence against its own citizens. When states resort to torture—including electrocution and sexual violence threats—to silence dissent, it signals a fundamental breakdown in democratic governance.

**Genocidal Rhetoric**: Perhaps most alarming are expert warnings of impending genocide, with documented evidence of Hindutva leaders openly calling for mass killings of Muslims. This isn't hyperbole—it's a pattern recognized by genocide prevention specialists worldwide.

## Why This Matters for Business and Policy

**Investment Climate**: Systematic persecution of minorities and violent suppression of civil society creates an unstable investment environment. Companies operating in or considering expansion to India must factor in reputational risks, potential sanctions, and the unpredictability that comes with authoritarian governance.

**Supply Chain Integrity**: As ESG considerations become central to business strategy, companies must evaluate whether their Indian operations or partnerships align with their stated values on human rights and democratic governance. The documented torture of activists and discriminatory legislation create significant compliance and reputational challenges.

**International Relations**: India's actions are straining relationships with key allies and trading partners. Muslim-majority countries are taking notice, and Western democracies face increasing pressure to respond. This diplomatic isolation could impact trade relationships and international cooperation agreements.

**Regional Stability**: The systematic marginalization of India's 200+ million Muslims has implications far beyond India's borders. Regional tensions, refugee flows, and the potential for mass atrocities create security challenges that affect global stability and economic confidence.

## The Path Forward

The international business and policy community has both the opportunity and responsibility to respond:

**Due Diligence**: Companies must conduct enhanced human rights due diligence for Indian operations, ensuring they're not complicit in or benefiting from discriminatory practices.

**Diplomatic Pressure**: Policymakers should leverage economic relationships to encourage respect for human rights and democratic norms. This includes considering targeted sanctions on officials responsible for documented violations.

**Civil Society Support**: Supporting independent media, human rights organizations, and civil society groups in India is crucial for maintaining accountability and protecting democratic space.

**Long-term Perspective**: While India remains an important economic partner, sustainable business relationships require stable, predictable governance based on rule of law—not arbitrary persecution of minorities and violent suppression of dissent.

## A Moment of Truth

India stands at a crossroads. The country's economic potential and democratic traditions have made it a valued partner for businesses and governments worldwide. However, the systematic targeting of minorities and violent suppression of civil society documented this week represents a fundamental departure from the values that made India an attractive partner.

The international community's response will determine whether these violations escalate or whether India returns to its democratic foundations. Business leaders and policymakers who remain silent risk becoming complicit in a trajectory that threatens not only India's minorities and activists but the broader principles of human rights and democratic governance that underpin the international order.

The time for action is now. The cost of inaction—measured in human lives, democratic erosion, and regional instability—is simply too high.
