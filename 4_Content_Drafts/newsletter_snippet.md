## ðŸš¨ **Crisis Update: Systematic Persecution Escalates Under BJP Rule**

This week brought deeply troubling evidence of India's accelerating campaign against minorities and civil society. Three critical developments demand immediate international attention and coordinated response.

### **Discriminatory Legislation Targets Muslim Religious Institutions**

The BJP government has enacted the 2025 Waqf Amendment Act, a discriminatory law that fundamentally undermines Muslim constitutional rights. This legislation:

- **Strips religious autonomy** from Muslim communities by imposing bureaucratic control over religious endowments
- **Enables state seizure** of Muslim properties through retroactive challenges and burden-shifting
- **Mandates non-Muslim representation** on traditionally Muslim-governed religious boards
- **Institutionalizes discrimination** as part of the BJP's broader campaign to reshape India's secular framework

This represents the most significant legislative assault on Muslim religious freedom since independence, effectively giving the state unprecedented control over Islamic institutions.

### **Systematic Torture and Enforced Disappearances Documented**

CIVICUS Monitor has released shocking documentation of state-sanctioned torture against student activists in Delhi. The report reveals:

- **Enforced disappearances** of multiple student and youth activists over several days in July 2025
- **Systematic torture** including stripping victims naked, beating, electrocution, and submerging heads in toilet bowls
- **Threats of sexual violence** specifically targeting female activists
- **Forced signing** of blank documents for potential future incrimination

These actions constitute clear violations of international human rights law and demonstrate the government's willingness to use extreme violence to silence dissent.

### **Experts Warn of Impending Genocide Against Muslims**

A comprehensive assessment warns that India has reached a dangerous tipping point, with "Islamophobia taking its most lethal form" as Hindutva leaders openly call for mass killings of Muslims. The analysis documents:

- **Systematic discrimination** against Muslims, Christians, and Dalits across all spheres of life
- **Open calls for violence** by Hindutva leaders advocating mass killings and weapon use against Muslims
- **State complicity** in creating an environment conducive to mass atrocities
- **Expert warnings** of potential genocide against Muslim communities

### **International Implications and Urgent Actions Needed**

These developments have far-reaching implications for:

**Diaspora Communities:** Indian Muslim diaspora face increased anxiety for family members, while broader South Asian communities grapple with India's democratic backsliding.

**International Relations:** India's relationships with Muslim-majority countries and human rights-focused allies face significant strain as evidence of systematic persecution mounts.

**Civil Society:** Domestic and international NGOs operate under increasing threat, with enhanced risks of harassment, funding restrictions, and legal persecution.

### **What You Can Do**

The international community must respond decisively:

1. **Contact your representatives** to demand targeted sanctions on officials responsible for human rights violations
2. **Support organizations** providing legal aid and protection to at-risk activists and minorities
3. **Amplify awareness** by sharing credible information about India's human rights crisis
4. **Advocate for UN intervention** through Special Rapporteurs on torture, religious freedom, and minority rights

### **Looking Ahead**

IAMC continues monitoring these critical developments and coordinating with international partners to document violations, support victims, and advocate for accountability. The situation demands sustained attention and coordinated international response to prevent further escalation toward mass atrocities.
