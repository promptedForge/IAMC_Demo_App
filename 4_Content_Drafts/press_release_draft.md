## India's Human Rights Crisis Escalates: New Reports Document Systematic Torture of Activists and Discriminatory Legislation Targeting Muslims

**September 10, 2025** – The Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) condemns the alarming escalation in human rights violations across India, as documented in multiple credible reports released this week. New evidence reveals a coordinated campaign by the BJP government to systematically target minorities and civil society through discriminatory legislation, state-sanctioned torture, and the promotion of genocidal rhetoric.

### Systematic Torture and Enforced Disappearances

According to a new report by CIVICUS Monitor, Indian authorities have engaged in the systematic torture and enforced disappearance of student activists in Delhi. The report documents horrific abuses, including activists being "stripped naked, beaten, electrocuted, and subjected to degrading treatment including having their heads submerged in toilet bowls," with specific threats of sexual violence against female activists. These actions constitute clear violations of international human rights law and demonstrate the government's willingness to use extreme violence to silence dissent.

### Discriminatory Legislation Targets Muslim Religious Institutions

The recently enacted 2025 Waqf Amendment Act represents a direct assault on Muslim constitutional rights and religious autonomy. The legislation introduces unprecedented bureaucratic interference in religious endowments, enables potential state seizure of Muslim properties, and mandates non-Muslim representation on traditionally Muslim-governed boards. This discriminatory law fits within the BJP's broader campaign to reshape India's secular democratic framework along communal lines.

### Experts Warn of Impending Genocide

A comprehensive assessment warns that "Islamophobia has taken its most lethal form in India, with Hindutva leaders openly calling for mass killings and use of weapons against Muslims." The report documents systematic discrimination against Muslims, Christians, and Dalits across all spheres of life, with experts expressing grave concern about the potential for genocide against Muslim communities.

### International Response Urgently Needed

"The international community can no longer ignore the systematic persecution of minorities and activists in India," said [IAMC Spokesperson Name]. "The documented torture of student activists and the enactment of discriminatory legislation targeting Muslim institutions represent a dangerous escalation that demands immediate international intervention."

IAMC calls on the international community to:
- Impose targeted sanctions on officials responsible for human rights violations
- Suspend military and security cooperation with India until torture allegations are investigated
- Support UN investigations into systematic discrimination against minorities
- Provide protection and asylum for at-risk activists and minority community members
