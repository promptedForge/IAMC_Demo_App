üö® URGENT: India's Human Rights Crisis Escalates

New reports this week reveal a horrifying escalation in India's systematic targeting of minorities and civil society:

üìã DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION: The 2025 Waqf Amendment Act strips Muslim communities of religious autonomy and enables state seizure of religious properties

üîí SYSTEMATIC TORTURE: CIVICUS Monitor documents enforced disappearances and torture of student activists in Delhi, including electrocution and threats of sexual violence

‚ö†Ô∏è GENOCIDE WARNING: Experts warn of impending genocide as Hindutva leaders openly call for mass killings of Muslims

This represents a coordinated campaign to marginalize minorities through legal, institutional, and extrajudicial means while suppressing dissent through increasingly violent state repression.

The international community must act NOW:
‚úÖ Impose targeted sanctions on officials responsible
‚úÖ Suspend military cooperation until investigations occur
‚úÖ Support UN investigations into systematic discrimination
‚úÖ Provide protection for at-risk activists and minorities

India's democracy is under attack. Silence is complicity.
